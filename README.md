## maze stuff


The absolute best book on mazes 
"mazes for programmers" by Jamis Buck

His clear explanation of the simple binary tree algorithm

and its biases and texture are really instructive.

He gives clear examples. I have followed his draw-by-hand

description from chapter 1 and put it in to javaScrip

His code is in ruby and covered in chapter 2.
