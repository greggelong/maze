## maze stuff


The absolute best book on mazes 
"mazes for programmers" by Jamis Buck

His clear explanation of the simple binary tree algorithm

and its biases and texture are really instructive.

He gives clear examples. I have followed his draw-by-hand

description from chapter 1 and put it in to javaScript

His code is in ruby and covered in chapter 2.

Jamis Buck in his book "Mazes" explains that a maze texture and bias arise from the algorithm that generates them. 

The binary tree algorithm uses coin flips that either remove a cells north wall or east wall.

This produces a maze that has the interesting texture of long unbroken north and east corridors. 

These make such a maze trivial to escape if the exit is in that direction. 

But starting from the north east corner and exiting at south west is much less trivial.

This can be an analogy for the mazes of options in our life.  What processes are removing or placing walls or obstacles.  What textures and biases do our problems have. And maybe a change of perspective can help us solve these problems.
